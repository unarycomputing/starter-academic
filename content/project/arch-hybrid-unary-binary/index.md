Unary computing applies unary bit streams as internal data, and mitigates the conversion of data from unary to binary in converntional computers, leading to less system-level latency, as in the diagram.
Currently, unary computing has already been applied to low-density parity-check code, image processing and machine learning. We create [UnarySim](https://github.com/diwu1990/UnarySim) to accurately simulate the behavior of unary computing at cycle level.
